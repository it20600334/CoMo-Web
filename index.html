            <p align="justify">
              Recent studies have explored various animal classification methods, particularly focusing on
              acoustic and visual techniques. Vithakshana L. G. C, Samankula W. G. D. M introduced an IoTbased animal classification system utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN). Their
              hardware setup collected audio data, which was preprocessed using Mel-frequency Cepstral
              Coefficients (MFCC) and formatted using Audacity. The CNN, implemented with TensorFlow,
              trained on 400 sound clips, 40 from each of 10 animal species.
              Che Yong Yeo, S. A. R. Al-Haddad, and C. K. Ng presented an animal identification system based
              on voice pattern recognition. Their approach integrated zero-cross-rate (ZCR), MFCC, and
              Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithms to accurately identify animals by their vocal patterns,
              filtering out silence and extracting distinct voice features.
              Additionally, authors proposed a bird classifier system using bird audio recordings and MFCC.
              They tested various algorithms such as Na√Øve Bayes, J4.8, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), with
              J4.8 achieving the highest accuracy of 78.40%. K.H. Frommolt and K.H. Tauchert researched bird
              call detection using two CNN approaches in bioacoustic monitoring systems.
              <br>In response to the persistent challenge of animal encroachment in agricultural fields, researchers
              have been developing innovative solutions to mitigate crop damage and protect farmers'
              livelihoods. Sheik Mohammed, Dr. T. Sheela, and Dr. T. Muthumanickam introduced a system
              that combines a modified CNN algorithm, thermal imaging, PIR sensors, GSM modules, and
              Raspberry Pi for real-time monitoring and alerts, effectively addressing wildlife intrusion.
              Similarly, Manikandan et al. proposed a solution integrating Arduino, PIR motion sensors, Buzzer,
              LED lights, and GSM modules for rapid detection and response to animal intrusion, minimizing
              yield loss and enhancing crop protection.
              In Indian farmlands, Shola Usharani et al. presented an IoT-based solution using Arduino, PIR,
              Ultrasonic sensors, GSM, and ESP32 Camera, which detects animal intrusion, alerts farmers, and
              provides real-time field images, ensuring efficient protection while considering animal welfare.
              These studies highlight the significance of leveraging technological advancements like IoT,
              machine learning, and sensor networks to develop effective and humane solutions for mitigating
              crop damage caused by animal encroachment. By offering real-time monitoring, rapid detection,
              and timely alerts, these innovative systems hold promise for safeguarding farmers' livelihoods and
              promoting agricultural sustainability.
              <br>Agricultural pest infestation, particularly by macaque monkeys, poses a significant challenge to
              farming communities worldwide, leading to substantial economic losses. Researchers have begun
              focusing on innovative solutions to mitigate crop damage caused by animal encroachment. Studies
              have explored macaque monkeys' behavioral patterns, revealing insights into their foraging habits,
              movement dynamics, and interactions with humans. However, there's a gap in translating these
              insights into actionable information for farmers.
              Several major studies delve into macaque behavior, covering topics such as social networks,
              abnormal behaviors, age-related tendencies, and disease ecology. While literature on applying data
              analysis to predict monkey incursions on cultivated fields is limited, there's research on the
              financial consequences of monkey damage on commercial agriculture and human-monkey
              interactions in various environments.
              The collective research aims to better understand macaque behavior patterns, social dynamics, and
              implications for agricultural practices and welfare. While current literature provides valuable
              insights, future studies focusing on data analysis applications could further enhance understanding
              and aid in developing effective pest management strategies.
              Several research studies have proposed innovative solutions for detecting and managing diseases,
              pests, and nutrient deficiencies in coconut plantations, leveraging deep learning techniques, image
              processing, and Internet of Things (IoT) technology.
              <br>Vidhanaarachchi et al. introduce a smart solution utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs),
              image processing, and crowdsourcing to detect coconut diseases, pest infestations, and nutrient
              deficiencies. Their system achieves high accuracy rates and includes a bilingual mobile application
              for user-friendly disease identification and sharing of dispersion details, as well as a web
              application for disease monitoring and control measures.
              Nesarajan et al. present a system employing image processing and deep learning for identifying
              pest attacks, nutrient deficiencies, and diseases in coconut leaves. Their approach achieves high
              accuracy and focuses on rapid and non-destructive disease identification, particularly beneficial
              for large plantations where manual monitoring is challenging.
              Banerjee et al.propose a model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support
              Vector Machines (SVM) for detecting and classifying the severity levels of yellowing disease in
              coconut leaves. Their model demonstrates high effectiveness in disease severity assessment,
              incorporating a comprehensive four-phase methodology and achieving robust performance across
              different disease severity classes.
              Ekanayaka et al.introduce a unique approach to coconut pest detection by integrating IoT
              technology and deep learning, incorporating audio processing alongside visual data for more
              comprehensive pest identification. Their system enables real-time monitoring, knowledge
              dissemination to farmers, and achieves high accuracy rates in identifying specific coconut pest
              infestations.
              Future developments in these research areas may include integrating environmental sensor data
              for predictive modeling, automating pest management recommendations, and conducting field
              trials to assess scalability and practical performance.

                Detecting and managing pests, especially those with significant economic and ecological impacts, is
a crucial area of research in agriculture and environmental science. However, a notable gap exists in
the literature regarding the use of sound analysis for detecting macaque monkeys, which pose serious
challenges to agriculture and human-wildlife coexistence.
Previous research has explored sound-based approaches for detecting pests like insects and birds but
has not focused specifically on macaque monkeys. This gap highlights the novelty of using sound
analysis to identify and track macaque monkey activity in agricultural settings. Moreover, while IoT
devices and deep learning algorithms have been individually studied for pest detection, their
integration, especially for macaque monkey detection, is lacking. Combining these technologies can
significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of detecting and tracking macaques.
Another gap is the absence of real-time monitoring and location tracking in previous pest detection
studies using sound analysis. Although some research has utilized sound analysis, the lack of realtime capabilities limits effective monitoring and response to pest activity.
Previous efforts have used computer vision and machine learning to tackle animal intrusion in
agricultural fields, achieving accuracies below 94%. However, there remains a need for higher
accuracy in detecting and alerting farmers to potential threats. Existing systems often alert farmers
about animal presence without providing detailed information about the crop's condition. This
highlights the need for research that not only improves detection accuracy but also incorporates realtime crop monitoring.
Addressing this gap involves developing advanced systems that surpass the 94% accuracy threshold
and offer comprehensive alerts, including detailed insights into crop conditions. Such research would
enhance crop protection and improve farmers' decision-making processes.
Furthermore, there is a need to integrate the analysis of macaque monkey presence and behavior
patterns to predict future risks accurately. Some studies have examined macaque behavior and its
impact on crops, but there is a lack of comprehensive predictive models that can translate these
insights into actionable predictions for farmers. Additionally, data visualization techniques have not
been effectively used to demonstrate macaque distribution and behavior. More sophisticated visual
representations are needed to convey complex movement patterns and potential crop risk areas.

                sound analysis, IoT devices, deep learning algorithms, and advanced data visualization, researchers
                can create more effective and sustainable pest management strategies. These integrated systems
                would not only detect and repel macaques more accurately but also offer real-time monitoring and
                detailed alerts, significantly enhancing farmers' ability to protect their crops and improve their

          <h3 class="section-title">Research Problem</h3>
            <span class="section-divider"></span>
            <p align="justify">
              The primary issue in agricultural settings is detecting and repelling macaque monkeys,
              which can appear unpredictably at any time. Traditional methods like manual observation and
              physical barriers are labor-intensive, inefficient, and often fail to provide timely detection. This
              unpredictability causes significant problems for farmers who cannot constantly monitor their
              fields, highlighting the need for more effective solutions.
              To address this, the study proposes an innovative solution using sound analysis, IoT
              devices, and deep learning algorithms. This approach aims to provide farmers with a more efficient
              way to detect and repel macaques, reducing labor and ecological impact. The key challenge is
              accurately confirming the presence of monkeys in real-time and developing effective, humane
              repelling methods while managing false alarms. The goal is to enhance detection accuracy and
              create robust systems that protect crops and consider animal welfare.
              Additionally, there is a need for a comprehensive framework to predict macaque monkey
              arrivals, routes, and future presence. Current research lacks predictive models that collectively
              answer these critical questions. Existing visualization methods do not effectively translate monkey
              movement and behavior into actionable insights for farmers. The challenge is to develop predictive
              modeling and advanced data visualization techniques that provide farmers with holistic answers
              about when and where monkeys will arrive and their future impact.
              Furthermore, there is a lack of integrated approaches to predict and mitigate future risks of
              macaque infestations in agriculture. While there is some understanding of macaque behavior and
              distribution, comprehensive predictive models that combine these patterns with ecological and
              environmental variables are missing. Effective data visualization techniques are also needed to
              accurately represent the complex movement dynamics and behavior of macaques in a way that is
              easy for farmers to understand and act upon.
              In summary, the research seeks to develop innovative, tech-driven solutions for detecting
              and repelling macaque monkeys, improving prediction and visualization of their movements, and
              enhancing farmers' preparedness for managing these pests. This involves integrating advanced
              technologies like IoT, deep learning, and predictive modeling to create efficient, humane, and
              sustainable pest management strategies.

                    Keras is an open-source library that provides a Python interface for 
                    artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow 
                    library. Up until version 2.3 Keras supported multiple backends, including 
                    TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, and PlaidML.
